# Function Frontend

The "Function Frontend" project integrates a simple Ethereum smart contract with frontend web development, enabling users to manage and display data from the contract in real-time on a web interface.

## Description

The "Function Frontend" project combines Ethereum smart contract functionality with frontend web development. It includes creating a straightforward smart contract with functions for setting and retrieving data, then displaying these values dynamically on a web application. This setup allows users to interact directly with blockchain-based data through an intuitive and responsive user interface.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

Here are the steps for executing the "Function Frontend" project:

1. **Smart Contract Creation**: Write a simple Ethereum smart contract with functions to set and get data (like messages or numbers).

2. **Compile and Deploy**: Compile the smart contract using Remix IDE, then deploy it to a local Ethereum network.

3. **Copy ABI**: Copy the ABI (Application Binary Interface) from Remix and save it to your frontend project directory.

4. **Frontend Setup**: Create an HTML file with fields to display and update contract data. Use Web3.js to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the deployed contract.

5. **Run the Frontend**: Open the HTML file in a web browser. Ensure your local Ethereum node is running or use an Infura endpoint for live networks.

6. **Interact with Contract**: Use the provided frontend interface to set new values in the contract and observe the updated values displayed dynamically on the webpage.

These steps enable seamless interaction between a frontend application and an Ethereum smart contract, showcasing real-time data management on the blockchain.
